It is intended as a quick recap of all the major concepts and also a way to get used to the syntax of Python. \n",

    "Key Differences:\n",
    "Indentation: Python uses indentation to define code blocks, whereas MATLAB uses keywords like end to mark the end of blocks. In Python, after a colon (:) following an if or else statement, the indented block of code is executed if the condition is true.\n",
    "Colon (:): In Python, a colon is used after the if and else statements to denote the start of the code block.\n",

    "Python uses and, or, not as logical operators instead of &&, ||, ~ used in MATLAB.\n",

    "Python also has elif (short for else if) which can be used to check multiple conditions.\n",
